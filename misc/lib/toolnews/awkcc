========
Updated source to use stdarg.h instead of varargs.h.  Ported to idarwin.
(Like ilinux, the idarwin version does all builds with -m32)

03/16/11
========
User reported that awkcc is failing on 64-bit linux.   Updated the
awkcc.sh script so that compiles will be done in 32-bit mode on both
32-bit and 64-bit linux machines.   The resulting awkcc binary will
be  32-bits, but that compile and run on 64-bit machines as long as
the necessary headers and libraries are installed.

02/15/06
========
User reported a bug that can cause parsing failures when the input contains
8-bit characters (with values greater than 127)

08/31/05
========
Ported to cygwin and darwin.   The recently added ilinux, darwin, and cygwin 
versions now pass nearly all of the regression tests included in the awkcc 
source package.

08/30/05
========
Ported to ilinux.   The linux version has had very little testing, but
is able to compile and run some trivial awk programs.

OLD NEWS
========
The RDS version 2.0 of awkcc now in exptools
