The awkcc package requires that a C compiler is available.  This
package has been tested with the scde 2.02.00 version of this compiler
and has preset the CC variable to point to the /bin/cc file for
this compiler.  If a different compiler is used then please contact
the RDS hotline for assistance with the installation of awkcc.
