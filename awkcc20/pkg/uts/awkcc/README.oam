# To package, issue a command like this:

pkgmk -r / -d /tmp awkcc

# This command will pick up binaries installed on the system
# (all built by the postsrc package),

# To translate this package directory to datastream format (e.g.,
# single file) issue a command like this:

pkgtrans /tmp /tmp/awkcc.oam awkcc
