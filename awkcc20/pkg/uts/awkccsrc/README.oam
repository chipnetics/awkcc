# To package, issue a command like this:

pkgmk -r / -b /usr/add-on -d /tmp awkccsrc

# This command will pick up the source under "base"
# directory /usr/add-on and the packaging files from 
# the current work directory, and put the package in /tmp.   
# With no -d, the package is put in /var/spool/pkg by default.

# To translate this package directory to datastream form (single
# file; e.g., for stockroom) issue a command like this:

pkgtrans /tmp /tmp/awkccsrc.oam awkccsrc
