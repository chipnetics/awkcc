The awkcc package requires that a C compiler is available.  This
package has been tested with the native2.1 version of this compiler
and has preset the CC variable to point to the /bin/cc
file for this compiler.  The CCS variable must be set to "native" and
exported. If a different compiler is used then please contact the 
RDS hotline for assistance with the installation of awkcc.
