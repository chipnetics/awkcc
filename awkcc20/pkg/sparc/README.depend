The awkcc package requires that a C compiler is available.  This
package has been tested with the SUNPRO version of this compiler
and has preset the CC variable to point to the /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
file for this compiler.  If a different compiler is used then
please contact the RDS hotline for assistance with the installation
of awkcc.  Awkcc was tested with version 2.0.1 of the SPARCompiler;
however, any later release of this compiler should be compatible
upwardly with the awkcc product.
