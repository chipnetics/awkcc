#Brian:
#
#It appears that awk does not apply OFMT consistently when printing numbers.
#Here is a small script that demonstrates the problem:  are you going to
#leave this behavior unchanged?  
#I need to know whether I should go out of my way to mimic it.
#
#Thanks,
#
#Chris

# Demo script:  the integers are printed without their .0 suffixes.
# Variant:  without the first statement, the third number should be
# printed as 10e8 (according to default OFMT=%.6g) but is not.
BEGIN {
	OFMT="%.20g"
	val = 1000.06;		print val
				print val + 0	
	val = 1000;		print val
				print val + 0	
	val = 1000000000;	print val
				print val + 0	
}
